Adds a Save and Close button to the admin post edit screen which allows you to return to the post listing page after editing.

== Description ==

Does what it says on the tin! 

So what is the plugin? The name says it all really, this just adds a Save and Close button to all pages, posts and custom post types. We've done away with the click so no longer do you need to hit "Update" or "Publish" then click back your post/page listing. Save and Close will just take you right back to your list of posts! Simples! 

At Lightbulb we love to give a little back and this is our way of saying thanks to WordPress. Also to all of our comrades populating websites or doing lots of edits this one is for you! Saving those precious seconds and making your lives happy and RSI free.
